# Hello, I'm Aleksandar Stojanovic or short - Alex! üëã

## üöÄ About Me

I'm a passionate **QA Automation Engineer** with a focus on designing, implementing, and optimizing automation frameworks to enhance software quality and efficiency. With a deep understanding of both the technical and strategic aspects of quality assurance, I specialize in creating robust, scalable, and maintainable automation frameworks that drive quality from the ground up.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Toolbox

Leveraging a broad set of tools and technologies, I ensure seamless and effective automation across various environments:

- **Languages:** Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Automation Tools:** Selenium, Appium, Cypress, Webdriverio, Playwright, Supertest
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, AWS Pipelines
- **Testing Frameworks:** TestNG, JUnit, pytest, NUnit, Mocha, Chai
- **Others:** Docker, Kubernetes, Postman, JIRA

And a lot more...

## üìö My Projects

On my GitHub, you'll find a variety of **QA Automation Framework Template Projects** that serve as a starting point or inspiration for your own test automation efforts. These templates are designed with best practices in mind and are easily adaptable to different project needs.

- [JAMSTEC](https://github.com/automatewithalex/automatewithalex/JAMSTEC) - JAMSTEC is an innovative Java-based automation framework that integrates Selenium, TestNG, and Cucumber to facilitate efficient web application testing. This framework is designed to simplify the creation, execution, and management of automated test cases with a focus on behavior-driven development (BDD). It supports parallel execution to accelerate testing processes and offers a modular architecture for easy scalability. A distinctive feature of JAMSTEC is its integration with Allure, an open-source framework designed for beautiful and concise reporting. This ensures that test results are not only easily accessible but also presented in an engaging and informative manner, enhancing the analysis and understanding of test outcomes. By bridging the gap between technical specifications and business requirements with human-readable test scenarios, JAMSTEC provides a robust, flexible, and user-friendly platform for web testing, suitable for educational purposes, personal projects, or professional testing environments.

## üåü Future Goals

In my journey to explore and master QA automation, I plan to create an extensive portfolio of projects encompassing a wide array of languages, tools, and testing domains. My aim is to develop frameworks not just for web UI testing but also for API, mobile, desktop, and performance testing. Each project will leverage different technologies and approaches to address the unique challenges of each testing type. 

**My ultimate goal** is to culminate these efforts into a mega project that integrates all aspects of QA automation into a single, unified framework. This ambitious project will cover UI, mobile, desktop, web, and performance API tests, offering a comprehensive solution for automated testing across different platforms and technologies. By achieving this, I aspire to provide an unparalleled resource for the QA automation community‚Äîmaking it easier for anyone, from beginners to seasoned professionals, to access, learn from, and contribute to the evolving field of software quality assurance.

My goal is to build a comprehensive suite of automation frameworks that can serve as a valuable resource for anyone in the QA automation field, from beginners to seasoned professionals.

## üí° My Philosophy

In the rapidly evolving field of software development, I believe in the power of automation to not only detect issues early but also to streamline the development process, enabling teams to focus on innovation and deliver value faster. My approach combines strategic planning, continuous learning, and a deep passion for quality, aiming to bridge the gap between development and operations for a more efficient and effective workflow.
